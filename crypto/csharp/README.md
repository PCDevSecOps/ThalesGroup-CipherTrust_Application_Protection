## Prerequisites: 

      1.In order to run C# samples, .NetCore 3.1 should be installed.

      2.To use these sample files, the user must have CADP.NetCore.nupkg.

For more information on CADP.NetCore and samples, refer to the CADP.NetCore user guide.

### Note: 
      1.Before using these cs files, create the console application.
      2.Add the required cs files to the project.
      3.Add the CADP.NetCore.nupkg to the project and build the project.
      4.Use either of the following commands to execute the project.
        a.Either use dotnet run command to run the project. Example: dotnet run.
        b.Or use dotnet command to run using the <fileName>.dll. Example: dotnet <filename>.dll
        c.Or Use <fileName>.exe to run the code directly [only for windows]. Example: <filename>.exe
