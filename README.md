# CipherTrust Application Protection

## Overview

`The CipherTrust Application Protection provides a framework to deliver application-layer encryption such as column- or field-level encryption in databases, Big Data, or PaaS applications. CipherTrust Application Protection also provides a standards-based API to do cryptographic and encryption key management operations into existing corporate`

## Examples

**CipherTrust Tokenization Server**

`The CipherTrust Tokenization Server package is a platform-independent virtual appliance that comprises three security services:`

Tokenization service - `Tokenization is used for replacing sensitive data with tokenized, or encrypted, data. Data masking can be applied to any detokenized data to hide sections of the data from different groups of users.`

Key management services - `Using the key provider and repository, users-- whether human or machine-- can be granted permission to create, modify, find, import, export, and/or destroy encryption keys. The Vormetric Key Management REST APIs are used to integrate this functionality into a developer’s application.`

Cryptographic services - `CTS also includes data encryption, decryption, sign, and verify services which can be tied to specific keys and user permissions. They can also be integrated into a developer’s application using the Vormetric Cryptographic REST APIs.`
